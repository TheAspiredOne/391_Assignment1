This zip file contains:
*README.txt
*q0.txt
*q1.txt
*q2.c
*q3.c
*q4.c
*q5.c
*q6.c
*q7.c
*q8.c
*q9.c


C Libraries used:
*stdio.h
*sqlite3.h
*stdlin.h
*string.h
*math.h



Instructions for using this codebase:

*extract all files into the same directory and open a terminal
*you MUST copy and paste line 2 of q0.txt into the terminal in order to start SQLITE3 and create the empty database
*copy and paste lines 5 to the end of q0.txt in order to create and populate tables




TO USE q2.c
*in th directory, compile the code by running 'gcc -g q2.c sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl' without the quotes.
*execute the code by typing './a.out' without the quotes


TO USE q3.c
*in th directory, compile the code by running 'gcc -g q3.c sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl' without the quotes.
*execute the code by typing './a.out' without the quotes


TO USE q4.c (DIFFERENCE COMPILE CODE FROM THE REST!)
*in th directory, compile the code by running 'gcc -g q4.c sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl -lm' without the quotes.
*execute the code by typing './a.out' without the quotes


TO USE q5.c (DIFFERENCE COMPILE CODE FROM THE REST!)
*in th directory, compile the code by running 'gcc -g q5.c sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl -lm' without the quotes.
*execute the code by typing './a.out' without the quotes


TO USE q6.c
*in th directory, compile the code by running 'gcc -g q6.c sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl' without the quotes.
*execute the code by typing './a.out' without the quotes


TO USE q7.c
*in th directory, compile the code by running 'gcc -g q7.c sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl' without the quotes.
*execute the code by typing './a.out' without the quotes


TO USE q8.c
*in th directory, compile the code by running 'gcc -g q8.c sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl' without the quotes.
*execute the code by typing './a.out' without the quotes


TO USE q9.c
*in th directory, compile the code by running 'gcc -g q9.c sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl' without the quotes.
*execute the code by typing './a.out <IATA>' without the quotes where IATA is the IATA of your choice.
